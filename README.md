Source code for the demo website

## How to run this demo
1. Download this code
2. Start a server with Python (`python3 -m http.server`)
3. Open your browser on `localhost:8000` (this should be the default port from
   the command above, but if that doesn't work maybe double-check what port was
   used)
4. Done!
